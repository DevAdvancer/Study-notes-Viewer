# Unit-I: Introduction to Unstructured Database
## 1. What is Unstructured Data?
=> Unstructured data refers to information that does not follow a predefined format or schema, making it more difficult to store, search, and analyze using traditional database systems.
## 2. Examples of Unstructured Data

## 3. Characteristics of Unstructured Data
1. No Fixed Format → Unlike structured data in tables, unstructured data can be free-flowing (text, images, videos). <br />
**Example**: A news article has paragraphs and headlines but no rigid structure. <br />
2. Large Volume → It makes up 80-90% of global data and is growing rapidly. <br />
**Example**: Millions of images are uploaded to Instagram daily. <br />
3. Variety of Formats → Includes text, images, videos, sensor logs, etc. <br />
**Example**: A single customer interaction can have emails, chat messages, and call recordings. <br />
4. Difficult to Analyze → Requires advanced tools like AI and NLP to extract insights. <br />
**Example**: Google uses AI to analyze millions of search queries and web pages. <br />
## 4. Challenges of Unstructured Data
#### (1) Volume – Too Much Data to Handle
- Huge amounts of unstructured data are generated every second.
- Example: YouTube receives 500+ hours of video uploads per minute.
#### (2) Variety – Many Different Formats
- Data comes in different types (text, images, audio, video, etc.).
- Example: A self-driving car collects sensor data, video footage, and GPS logs.
#### (3) Velocity – Data is Generated in Real-Time
- Data needs to be processed quickly, often in real-time.
- Example: Stock market trading systems process millions of transactions per second.
#### (4) Complexity – Hard to Analyze and Search
- Extracting useful information is difficult.
- Example: AI is needed to analyze customer sentiment from social media comments.
