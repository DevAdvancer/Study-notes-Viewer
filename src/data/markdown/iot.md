> Kevin Ashton is the founder of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the inventor of the term.

## IOT
IoT stands for Internet of Things, and it's a network of physical objects that are connected to the internet and can communicate with each other and with other devices. IoT devices, also known as "smart objects", are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that allow them to collect and share data.
#### Characteristics of IOT
- Interconnectivity
- Things Related Services
- Hetroginity
- Dynamic Change
- Enomous Scale

## what is Moore's law?
Moore's Law is a term used to describe the rate at which computer chip technology improves. It was first proposed by Gordon Moore in 1965, who observed that the number of transistors on a CPU had doubled every 18 months since the introduction of the Intel 4004 microprocessor in 1971. <br />
Moore's Law states that processing power and integrated circuits (ICs) will continue to double approximately every two years. This means that the cost of adding more transistors per chip is falling as chip technology improves, allowing for greater speed and performance. The current estimate is that Moore's Law may not hold true in 2035 due to changes in the semiconductor industry and the growing complexity of modern systems.

## Metcalfe's Law
Metcalfe's Law is a networking theory that states that the value of an interconnected system, such as the Internet, increases exponentially with the number of connections between users. In other words, each new connection adds a significant amount of value to the network, making it more useful and valuable. <br />
### Mathematical Formulation
The law can be mathematically expressed as follows:
Value = 2^<sup>(Number of additional users added)</sup> <br />
This formula shows that each new connection adds twice as much value as the previous one. This exponential growth makes it clear why Metcalfe's Law is so powerful: adding just a few more connections can dramatically increase the overall value of the network. <br />
